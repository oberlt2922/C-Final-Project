# C-Final-Project

Final Exam – Due Tuesday, April 28, 2020

You are a Real Estate developer.  Your job is to develop a website that is easily maintainable and attractive. Your job is to create a page of new house properties.  There need to be small clips of house images along with a property cost and the number of square footage under the picture.  This list will be displayed based on a dropdown menu of counties in Georgia (such as Richmond & Columbia County).  The dropdown must be on the same page as the properties.  Please make use of grid view and repeater controls.  All data must be in the SQL Server Database, and data must not be hardcoded in the application.

Another main task of the final is to make use of JQuery/Ajax to where a user hovers over a property, a brief description displayed along with open house times associated with the property.  When you leave the property, the hovered information vanishes.

The application should still function like the midterm. That’s if one clicks on the 
small home image clip, a new page should open with a larger image. The project must include pictures both inside and outside of the house. It must also include a full description of the home, such as dimension, heating, and AC units, etc. 

Let’s limit the properties to 4 counties of your choice and five properties per county.
Lastly, their needs to be the use of a CSS style sheet along with a banner.  Let the banner from a page other than home to go back to home.  The banner should blend nicely with the theme of the project.

There needs to be an Admin section for when a user clicks on an admin button located as an overlay on the banner image.  The page should also allow the ability to add, edit, and delete a property item (ex: thus, data will replace existing parts of the page as if the page was a template).  Lastly, have a scheduled page for users to request to view home in the SQL Server database.

The deliverables for this final project is the Application, SQL Server database included in the project along with a design document on your thought process.

Please make the site look professional with good CSS.  Your grade will be determined based on professionalism as well as functionality.  The final is due on April 28, 2020, by the end of the day.  Remember for the final exam that there is no late submittals accepted.
